# Assignment 13

Due in class Thursday of Week 4

1. Consider the set $A=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ consisting of five elements. We define a relation $R$ on $A$ via $x R y$ if and only if the product $xy$ is even. Determine if $R$ is an equivalence relation, and if so find the equivalence classes.
2. Suppose $U$ is a set of five elements, $U=\{a,b,c,d,e\}$. We then consider the set $A = P(U)$, the powerset of $U$, which consists of all subsets of $U$. We define on $A$ two relations (so these relations take as elements subsets of $U$). The first, $R_1$, is defined by saying that two subsets $B_1$, $B_2$ of $U$ are related if and only if their intersection $B_1\cap B_2$ is nonempty. The second, $R_2$, is defined by saying that two subsets $B_1$, $B_2$ of $U$ are related if and only if their union $B_1\cup B_2$ is nonempty. Are these relations equivalences? Prove or disprove.
3. Consider a set $A$ and a relation $R$ on $A$ with the following properties:
    - $R$ is reflexive and transitive.
    - For every $x$ in $A$ there is a $y$ in $A$ such that $xRy$ (i.e. every element is related to *some* element, which may or may not be equal to it).

    Then show that $R$ is also symmetric.
