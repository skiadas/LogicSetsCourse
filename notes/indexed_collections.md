# Indexed Collections

- Read pages 24 through 27 (section 1.4)
- Some key questions to answer:
    1. Explain why we need a notation for an indexed collection of sets
    2. How do we define and denote the union of an indexed collection of sets?
    3. How do we define and denote the intersection of an indexed collection of sets?
    4. How do we denote in general an indexed collection of sets over a more general index set? How do we denote the union and the intersection of such a collection?
    5. Study example 1.21
    6. Food for thought: What if the index set is the empty set (an empty collection)? Can we make sense of that? What should the union and the intersection of such a collection be?
