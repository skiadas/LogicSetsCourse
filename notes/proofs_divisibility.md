# Proofs involving divisibility

- Read carefully pages 99 through 103 (section 4.1)
- Some key questions to answer (try these without looking at the book, but after you've read the book):
    1. When do we say that an integer $a$ is a *multiple* of an integer $b$?
    2. When do we say that an integer $a$ is a *divides* an integer $b$?
    3. Write down all eight divisors of 6.
    4. Do the notions of "multiple" and "divisor" make sense if we use real numbers instead of integers? Explain.
    5. True or False: $0$ is a multiple of all integers.
    6. Prove that for nonzero integers $a$ and $b$, if $a$ divides $b$ and $b$ divides $c$, then it must be the case that $a$ divides $c$.
    7. Prove that for integers $a$, $b$, $c$, if $a$ divides $b$ and $c$ divides $d$, then $ac$ divides $bd$.
    8. Prove that for integers $a$, $b$, $c$, $x$, $y$, if $a$ divides $b$ and also divides $c$, then $a$ also divides $bx + cy$.
    9. Using a contrapositive, prove that for integers $x$, $y$, if $3$ does not divides the product $xy$ then $3$ cannot divide $x$ or $y$.
    10. True or False: For every integer $x$, we can write $x$ as either $3k$ for some integer $k$, or $3k+1$ for some integer $k$ or $3k+2$ for some integer $k$ (and exactly one of these three forms works). Can you think of a proof of this fact?
    11. Prove that for integers $x$, $y$, we have that $2$ divides $x^2-y^2$ if and only if $4$ divides $x^2-y^2$.
    12. Prove that for integers $x$, $y$, we have that $x-y$ is even if and only if $x+y$ is even.
