# Principle of Mathematical Induction

- Read carefully pages 142 through 151 (section 6.1)
- Some key questions to answer:
    1. How do we define the *smallest/least/minimum* element of a nonempty set of real numbers?
    2. There are two very different reasons why a nonempty subset of the reals may not have a smallest element. Show examples of each.
    3. How do we prove that the smallest element of a set, if it exists, is unique?
    4. When do we say that a set of real numbers is *well-ordered*? How is this different than saying that the set has a smallest element?
    5. Give an example of a set that has a smallest element, but that is *not* well-ordered.
    6. What does the *well-ordering principle* say? Is it an axiom or a theorem?
    7. What does the *principle of mathematical induction* say? How do we prove it based on the well-ordering principle?
    8. How does a *proof by induction* proceed? What statements does it apply to? How are the individual steps called?
    9. Describe Gauss's approach to finding out the formula for the sum $1+2+\cdots + n$.
    10. What is the formula for the sum of squares of the natural numbers from $1$ to $n$? How does the proof by induction for the formula go?
    11. A non-empty subset of a well-ordered set is itself well-ordered. Prove it.
