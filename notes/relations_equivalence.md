# Equivalence Relations

- Read carefully pages 196 through 198 (section 8.3)
- Some key questions to answer:
    1. When do we say that a relation R on set A is an *equivalence relation*?
    2. For any given set A there is a "smallest possible" equivalence relation. Think of what that relation would be. What are the ordered pairs we are forced to add to an equivalence relation, no matter what?
    3. For a given equivalence relation $R$ on a set $A$, and an element $a\in A$, what is the *equivalence class* $[a]$?
    4. What is the equivalence class for an integer $n$ where the set $A=\mathbb{Z}$ and the equivalence relation is integer equality?
    5. Suppose that $A$ is a subset of the real numbers, such that the relation "less than or equal to" on $A$ is an equivalence. Prove that $A$ must have at most one element.
