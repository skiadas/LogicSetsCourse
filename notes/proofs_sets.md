# Proofs involving sets

- Read carefully pages 108 through 111 (section 4.4)
- Some key questions to answer (try these without looking at the book, but after you've read the book):
    1. How do we prove two sets are equal?
    2. Prove that for sets $A$, $B$ we have $A\setminus B = A\cap \bar B$.
    3. Prove that for sets $A$, $B$ we have $(A\cup B)\setminus(A\cap B) = (A\setminus B) \cup (B\setminus A)$.
    4. Prove that for sets $A$, $B$, $C$ if $A\subseteq B$ and $B\subseteq C$ then $A\subseteq C$.
    5. Prove that for sets $A$, $B$ we have $A\cup B = A$ if and only if $B\subseteq A$. Also devise a different proof of the forward direction, by using that $B\subseteq A\cup B$.
