# Subsets

- Read pages 18 through 21 (section 1.2)
- Some key questions to answer:
    1. When do we say that a set $A$ is a subset of another set $B$? How do we denote that?
    2. Is a set a subset of itself?
    3. Explain in precise terms why if $A$ is a subset of $B$ and $B$ is a subset of $C$, then $A$ must be a subset of $C$.
    4. Study example 1.5 carefully, make sure you understand it, and produce another example of it.
    5. True or False: For any two sets $A$, $B$, we must have either that $A$ is a subset of $B$ and that $B$ is a subset of $A$ (or both).
    6. How do we denote that a set is not a subset of another set?
    7. True or False: If $A$ is not a subset of $B$, then none of the elements of $A$ are in $B$.
    8. Is there a set that is a subset of all other sets?
    9. Does the empty set have any subsets?
    10. What is the meaning of a "universal set"?
    11. List the various kinds of intervals and write them both in interval notation and in set notation.
    12. When do we say that $A$ is a "proper subset" of $B$?
    13. Is there a set without any proper subsets?
    14. What is the "powerset" of a set $A$?
