- Read pages 39 through 40 (section 2.2)
- Some key questions to answer:
    1. What are various ways of expressing the negation of a statement?
    2. How does the truth table for the negation of a statement compare to that for the statement?
    3. When negating the statement "P: The integer 3 is odd", one of the forms that the book provides for that negation is "The integer 3 is even". This is not strictly speaking the negation of P. What important assumption about the integers does this form for the negation make?
    4. Food for thought: What is the negation of the negation of a statement? How does it compare to the original statement?
