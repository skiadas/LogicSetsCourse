# Set Properties

- Read carefully pages 111 through 114 (sections 4.5, 4.6)
- Some key questions to answer (try these without looking at the book, but after you've read the book):
    1. State and prove the distributive laws for sets.
    2. State and prove De Morgan's laws for sets.
    3. Prove that if $A$ is a subset of $B$ and $C$ is a subset of $D$, then $A\times C$ is a subset of $B\times D$.
    4. For sets $A$, $B$, $C$ show that $(A\cup B)\times C$ is equal to $(A\times C)\cup (B\times C)$.
    5. For sets $A$, $B$, $C$ show that $A\times (B\setminus C)$ is equal to $(A\times B)\setminus (A\times C)$.
    6. For sets $A$, $B$, $C$, how do $A\times(B\cap C)$ and $(A\times B)\cap (A\times C)$ compare?
