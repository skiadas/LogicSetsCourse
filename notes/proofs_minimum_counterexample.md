- Read carefully pages 158 through 15 (section 6.3)
- Some key questions to answer:
    1. What is a *minimum counterexample*?
    2. How does a *proof by minimum counterexample* proceed? What kinds of statements is it used for?
    3. After studying result 6.17, make sure you really understand how a proof by minimum counterexample proceeds, and why it might be a useful tool.
- Practice problems from section 6.3 (page 166): 6.33, 6.34, 6.38, 6.39
