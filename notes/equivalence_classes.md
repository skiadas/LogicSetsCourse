# Equivalence Classes

- Read carefully pages 198 through 202 (section 8.4)
- Some key questions to answer:
    0. True or False: An equivalence class $[a]$ for an element in an equivalence relation may be the empty set.
    1. Prove that if $R$ is an equivalence relation on a nonempty set $A$, and $a$, $b$ are two elements of $A$, then the elements are related if and only if their equivalence classes are identical sets. This is a very important proof to understand.
    2. Prove that if $R$ is an equivalence relation on a nonempty set $A$, and $a$, $b$ are two elements of $A$, then their equivalence classes are either identical sets (equal as sets) or are disjoint. Another way to phrase is that if $[a]\cap[b]\neq\emptyset$ then $[a] = [b]$.
    3. Prove that the equivalence classes of an equivalence relation on a set $A$ form a partition of $A$.
    4. Show that if we have a partition on a set $A$, then we can use that partition to define an equivalence relation on $A$ in such a way that the equivalence classes are exactly the subsets of $A$ that are the elements of the partition. Many steps to this:
        - Define the relation $R$.
        - Prove that it is an equivalence relation (reflexive, symmetric, transitive).
        - Show that if $a\in B$ and $B$ is one of the subsets in the partition, then $[a] = B$.
