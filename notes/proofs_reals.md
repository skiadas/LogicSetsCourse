# Proofs involving real numbers

- Read carefully pages 105 through 108 (section 4.3)
- Some key questions to answer (try these without looking at the book, but after you've read the book):
    1. True or False: $ab>0$ exactly when $a$, $b$ are both negative or both positive.
    2. Prove that the product $xy$ is equal to $0$ if and only if $x=0$ or $y=0$.
    3. Prove that for all real numbers $x$, $y$ we have $\frac{1}{3}x^2 + \frac{3}{4} y^2 \geq xy$.
    4. State and prove the triangle inequality.
    5. Prove that if for a real number $x$ and for $r>0$ we have $|x-1|<1$ and $|x-1|<r/4$, then it must be that $|x^2+x-2|<r$.
    6. True or False: If $|x-1|<1$ then:
        - $|x - 1| < 2$
        - $|x - 1| < 0.5$
        - $|x - 0.5| < 1$
        - $|x - 0.5| < 0.5$
        - $|x| < 1$
