# Implications

- Read pages 42 through 46 (sections 2.4 and 2.5)
- Some key questions to answer:
    1. What is an implication? What are the various ways we describe it (there are at least 5-6 verbal ways)?
    2. What is the truth table for an implication?
    3. Explain in your own words why an implication "if P then Q" is true when P is false.
    4. Is "if P then Q" the same as "if Q then P"? If not, provide an appropriate example.
    5. How can we express the truth table for "if P then Q" using negations, disjunctions and/or conjunctions?
    6. What are the hypothesis and the conclusion in an implication?
    7. Give examples of open sentences (involving a variable) with implications, and determine their truth or falseness for each value in the domain of the variable.
