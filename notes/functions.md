# Functions as relations

- Read carefully pages 216 through 219 (sections 9.1, 9.2)
- Some key questions to answer:
    1. A function from a set $A$ to $B$ is a special kind of relation from $A$ to $B$. What special property does it need to satisfy?
    2. What other name do we use for a function?
    3. How do we call the sets $A$ and $B$ in relation to a function $f\colon A\to B$?
    4. Explain why when we think of a function $f$ as a relation, i.e. a subset of $A\times B$, then the cardinality (number of elements) of that relation must equal the cardinality of $A$.
    5. What do we define as the *range* of a function $f$? How does it differ from the *codomain*?
    6. Consider the empty relation. When can that relation be a function?
    7. Consider the full relation $A\times B$. When can that relation be a function?
    8. When do we say that two functions are *equal*? Prove that this condition is equivalent to asking for the two functions to be equal as subsets of $A\times B$.
    9. Think about the following sentence: "If we have a real function $y=f(x)$ from Calculus, then its graph, a subset of $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$ is exactly what this function is thought of as a relation".
    10. How many functions are there from the set $A=\{1,2,3\}$ to the set $B=\{x, y\}$?
    11. In general, how many functions are there from a set with $k$ elements to a set with $n$ elements?
    12. Given a function $f\colon A\to B$ and a subset $C$ of $A$, what do we denote as the *image set* $f(C)$?
    13. Given a function $f\colon A\to B$ and a subset $D$ of $B$, what do we denote as the *inverse image set* $f^{-1}(D)$? Note that this is defined regardless of whether the function $f$ has an "inverse" in the sense learned in Calculus.
    14. What is $f(\emptyset)$? What is $f^{-1}(\emptyset)$?
    15. True or False: $x\in f^{-1}(D)$ if and only if $f(x) \in D$.
    16. Food for thought: The set of all functions $f\colon A\to\{0,1\}$ is in correspondence with the subsets of $A$:
        - Given such a function, we can associate it to the set $B=f^{-1}(\{1\})\subseteq A$.
        - Given a subset $B\subseteq A$, we can build a function $f\colon A\to\{0,1\}$ so that $f(x) = 1$ if $x\in B$ and $f(x) = 0$ if $x\not\in B$.
        - This is often called the "incidence function" or "characteristic function" of the subset.
    17. Suppose $f\colon A\to B$ is a function, thought of as a relation, i.e. subset of $A\times B$. Suppose $C\subseteq A$ is a subset of $A$. Consider the relation $f \cap \left(C\times B\right)$. Show that this defines a function from $C$ to $B$. This is known as the restriction of the domain of $f$ to $C$.
