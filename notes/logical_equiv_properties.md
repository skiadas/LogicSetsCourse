# Fundamental Properties of Logical Equivalence

- Read pages 53 through 55 (section 2.9)
- Some key questions to answer:
    1. List the fundamental properties of logical equivalence.
    2. Demonstrate, using these properties and the fact that $P\Rightarrow Q$ is logically equivalent $(\sim P) \lor Q$, that $\sim(P\Rightarrow Q)$ is logically equivalent to $P\land (\sim Q)$.
    3. Using the same rules, establish that $\sim (P\Leftrightarrow Q)$ is logically equivalent to $(P\land \sim Q) \lor (Q\land \sim P)$.
- Practice problems from section 2.9 (page 71): 2.60, 2.62, 2.64
