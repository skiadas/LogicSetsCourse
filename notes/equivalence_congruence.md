# Congruence as an equivalence relation

- Read carefully pages 202 through 207 (section 8.5)
- Some key questions to answer:
    1. When do we say that two numbers $a$, $b$ are congruent modulo $n$?
    2. Show that for any natural number $n\geq 2$, congruence modulo $n$ defines an equivalence relation on $\mathbb{R}$. This is a really important proof.
    3. What happens when $n=1$? Describe what congruence modulo $1$ would mean.
    4. Explain in simple terms what congruence modulo $2$ means. We have already worked with the more straightforward explanation of it.
    5. Define a relation $R$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ by saying that $aRb$ if and only if $2a+b$ is congruent to $0$ modulo $3$. Show that this is an equivalence relation.
