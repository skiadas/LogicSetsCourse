# Proofs involving congruences

- Read carefully pages 103 through 105 (section 4.2)
- Some key questions to answer (try these without looking at the book, but after you've read the book):
    1. For integers $a$, $b$, $n$, what is the definition of the phrase "$a$ is *congruent* to $b$ modulo $n$"?
    2. True or False: Every integer is congruent to $0$, $1$, $2$ or $3$ modulo $4$ (an exactly one of these is correct).
    3. For integers $a$, $b$, $k$, $n$, prove that if $a$ is congruent to $b$ modulo $n$ then $ka$ is congruent to $kb$ modulo $n$.
    4. For integers $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $n$, prove that if $a$ is congruent to $b$ modulo $n$ and $c$ is congruent to $d$ modulo $n$, then $a+c$ is congruent to $b+d$ modulo $n$ and also $ac$ is congruent to $bd$ modulo $n$.
    5. Show that for an integer $n$, if $n^2$ is not congruent to $n$ modulo $3$, then $n$ is not congruent to $0$ modulo $3$ or to $1$ modulo $3$.
