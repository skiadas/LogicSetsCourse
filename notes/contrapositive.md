# Proof by Contrapositive

- Read carefully pages 84 through 89 (section 3.3)
- Some key questions to answer:
    1. What does the contrapositive theorem (theorem 3.9) state?
    2. Describe in detail how a *proof by contrapositive* would go.
    3. Show examples of proofs by contrapositive.
    4. When do you think would we want to employ a proof by contrapositive?
    5. How do we prove results that are stated as a biconditional?
    6. Study carefully all example proofs in this section.
- Practice problems from section 3.3 (page 94): 3.17, 3.19, 3.21, 3.25
