# Cartesian Products

- Read pages 28 through 29 (section 1.6)
- Some key questions to answer:
    1. How does an ordered pair differ from a set with two elements?
    2. When are two ordered pairs considered equal?
    3. What is the Cartesian product of two sets?
    4. Give examples of Cartesian products.
    5. What is the cardinality of the Cartesian product of two sets?
    5. Food for thought: Can we generalize this to more than two sets? The corresponding ordered arrangements of elements are called tuples.
- Practice problems from section 1.6 (page 34): 1.59, 1.60, 1.63, 1.65
- Overall practice problems for chapter 1 (page 35): 1.70, 1.72, 1.77, 1.83
