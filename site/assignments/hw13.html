<h1 id="assignment-13">Assignment 13<span class="small"> (<a href="13.pdf" title="13">pdf</a>)</span></h1>
<p>Due in class Thursday of Week 4</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Consider the set <span class="math">\(A=\{1,2,3,4,5\}\)</span> consisting of five elements. We define a relation <span class="math">\(R\)</span> on <span class="math">\(A\)</span> via <span class="math">\(x R y\)</span> if and only if the product <span class="math">\(xy\)</span> is even. Determine if <span class="math">\(R\)</span> is an equivalence relation, and if so find the equivalence classes.</li>
<li>Suppose <span class="math">\(U\)</span> is a set of five elements, <span class="math">\(U=\{a,b,c,d,e\}\)</span>. We then consider the set <span class="math">\(A = P(U)\)</span>, the powerset of <span class="math">\(U\)</span>, which consists of all subsets of <span class="math">\(U\)</span>. We define on <span class="math">\(A\)</span> two relations (so these relations take as elements subsets of <span class="math">\(U\)</span>). The first, <span class="math">\(R_1\)</span>, is defined by saying that two subsets <span class="math">\(B_1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(B_2\)</span> of <span class="math">\(U\)</span> are related if and only if their intersection <span class="math">\(B_1\cap B_2\)</span> is nonempty. The second, <span class="math">\(R_2\)</span>, is defined by saying that two subsets <span class="math">\(B_1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(B_2\)</span> of <span class="math">\(U\)</span> are related if and only if their union <span class="math">\(B_1\cup B_2\)</span> is nonempty. Are these relations equivalences? Prove or disprove.</li>
<li>Consider a set <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and a relation <span class="math">\(R\)</span> on <span class="math">\(A\)</span> with the following properties:
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(R\)</span> is reflexive and transitive.</li>
<li>For every <span class="math">\(x\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> there is a <span class="math">\(y\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(xRy\)</span> (i.e.Â every element is related to <em>some</em> element, which may or may not be equal to it).</li>
</ul>
Then show that <span class="math">\(R\)</span> is also symmetric.</li>
</ol>
