<h1 id="functions-as-relations">Functions as relations</h1>
<ul>
<li>Read carefully pages 216 through 219 (sections 9.1, 9.2)</li>
<li>Some key questions to answer:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A function from a set <span class="math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is a special kind of relation from <span class="math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math">\(B\)</span>. What special property does it need to satisfy?</li>
<li>What other name do we use for a function?</li>
<li>How do we call the sets <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> in relation to a function <span class="math">\(f\colon A\to B\)</span>?</li>
<li>Explain why when we think of a function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> as a relation, i.e. a subset of <span class="math">\(A\times B\)</span>, then the cardinality (number of elements) of that relation must equal the cardinality of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>.</li>
<li>What do we define as the <em>range</em> of a function <span class="math">\(f\)</span>? How does it differ from the <em>codomain</em>?</li>
<li>Consider the empty relation. When can that relation be a function?</li>
<li>Consider the full relation <span class="math">\(A\times B\)</span>. When can that relation be a function?</li>
<li>When do we say that two functions are <em>equal</em>? Prove that this condition is equivalent to asking for the two functions to be equal as subsets of <span class="math">\(A\times B\)</span>.</li>
<li>Think about the following sentence: “If we have a real function <span class="math">\(y=f(x)\)</span> from Calculus, then its graph, a subset of <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\)</span> is exactly what this function is thought of as a relation”.</li>
<li>How many functions are there from the set <span class="math">\(A=\{1,2,3\}\)</span> to the set <span class="math">\(B=\{x, y\}\)</span>?</li>
<li>In general, how many functions are there from a set with <span class="math">\(k\)</span> elements to a set with <span class="math">\(n\)</span> elements?</li>
<li>Given a function <span class="math">\(f\colon A\to B\)</span> and a subset <span class="math">\(C\)</span> of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, what do we denote as the <em>image set</em> <span class="math">\(f(C)\)</span>?</li>
<li>Given a function <span class="math">\(f\colon A\to B\)</span> and a subset <span class="math">\(D\)</span> of <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, what do we denote as the <em>inverse image set</em> <span class="math">\(f^{-1}(D)\)</span>? Note that this is defined regardless of whether the function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> has an “inverse” in the sense learned in Calculus.</li>
<li>What is <span class="math">\(f(\emptyset)\)</span>? What is <span class="math">\(f^{-1}(\emptyset)\)</span>?</li>
<li>True or False: <span class="math">\(x\in f^{-1}(D)\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(f(x) \in D\)</span>.</li>
<li>Food for thought: The set of all functions <span class="math">\(f\colon A\to\{0,1\}\)</span> is in correspondence with the subsets of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>:
<ul>
<li>Given such a function, we can associate it to the set <span class="math">\(B=f^{-1}(\{1\})\subseteq A\)</span>.</li>
<li>Given a subset <span class="math">\(B\subseteq A\)</span>, we can build a function <span class="math">\(f\colon A\to\{0,1\}\)</span> so that <span class="math">\(f(x) = 1\)</span> if <span class="math">\(x\in B\)</span> and <span class="math">\(f(x) = 0\)</span> if <span class="math">\(x\not\in B\)</span>.</li>
<li>This is often called the “incidence function” or “characteristic function” of the subset.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Suppose <span class="math">\(f\colon A\to B\)</span> is a function, thought of as a relation, i.e. subset of <span class="math">\(A\times B\)</span>. Suppose <span class="math">\(C\subseteq A\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. Consider the relation <span class="math">\(f \cap \left(C\times B\right)\)</span>. Show that this defines a function from <span class="math">\(C\)</span> to <span class="math">\(B\)</span>. This is known as the restriction of the domain of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> to <span class="math">\(C\)</span>.</li>
