<h1 id="principle-of-mathematical-induction">Principle of Mathematical Induction</h1>
<ul>
<li>Read carefully pages 142 through 151 (section 6.1)</li>
<li>Some key questions to answer:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How do we define the <em>smallest/least/minimum</em> element of a nonempty set of real numbers?</li>
<li>There are two very different reasons why a nonempty subset of the reals may not have a smallest element. Show examples of each.</li>
<li>How do we prove that the smallest element of a set, if it exists, is unique?</li>
<li>When do we say that a set of real numbers is <em>well-ordered</em>? How is this different than saying that the set has a smallest element?</li>
<li>Give an example of a set that has a smallest element, but that is <em>not</em> well-ordered.</li>
<li>What does the <em>well-ordering principle</em> say? Is it an axiom or a theorem?</li>
<li>What does the <em>principle of mathematical induction</em> say? How do we prove it based on the well-ordering principle?</li>
<li>How does a <em>proof by induction</em> proceed? What statements does it apply to? How are the individual steps called?</li>
<li>Describe Gaussâ€™s approach to finding out the formula for the sum <span class="math">\(1+2+\cdots + n\)</span>.</li>
<li>What is the formula for the sum of squares of the natural numbers from <span class="math">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math">\(n\)</span>? How does the proof by induction for the formula go?</li>
<li>A non-empty subset of a well-ordered set is itself well-ordered. Prove it.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Practice problems from section 6.1 (page 165): 6.1, 6.5, 6.6b, 6.8, 6.9, 6.11</li>
</ul>
