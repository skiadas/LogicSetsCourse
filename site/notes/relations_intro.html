<h1 id="introduction-to-relations">Introduction to Relations</h1>
<ul>
<li>Read carefully pages 192 through 193 (section 8.1)</li>
<li>Some key questions to answer:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is a <em>relation <span class="math">\(R\)</span> from set <span class="math">\(A\)</span> to set <span class="math">\(B\)</span></em>?</li>
<li>If we have a relation <span class="math">\(R\)</span> from <span class="math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, and elements <span class="math">\(a\in A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\in B\)</span>, when do we say that <em><span class="math">\(a\)</span> is related to <span class="math">\(b\)</span> by the relation <span class="math">\(R\)</span></em>? How do we write that?</li>
<li>There are two extreme examples of relations. What are they? Describe them also in terms of when two elements are related by those relations.</li>
<li>What are the <em>domain</em> and <em>range</em> of a relation?</li>
<li>What are the domain and range for the two extreme relations from earlier?</li>
<li>How is the <em>inverse relation</em> defined?</li>
<li>A well-known relation from <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> is the “less-than” relation: <span class="math">\(x R y\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(x &lt; y\)</span>. What are the domain and range of this relation? What is the “inverse relation” to it?</li>
<li>How many relations are there on the empty set <span class="math">\(A=\emptyset\)</span>?</li>
<li>How many relations are there on a set <span class="math">\(A\)</span> with one element?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Practice problems from section 8.1 (page 210): 8.1, 8.2, 8.4, 8.5, 8.7</li>
